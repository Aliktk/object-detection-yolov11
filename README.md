## Installation

To get started with YOLO11, first, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics
```

# Usage

## Inference on Images

Follow these steps to perform object detection on an image using the YOLO11 model:

```python
Copy code
import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO
```

# Load YOLO11 model

```model

```

# Read the image

```python
image = cv2.imread("image.png")
```

# Define the prediction function

```python
def predict_and_detect(chosen_model, img, classes=[], conf=0.5, rectangle_thickness=2, text_thickness=1):
    results = chosen_model.predict(img, classes=classes, conf=conf)
    for result in results:
        for box in result.boxes:
            cv2.rectangle(img, (int(box.xyxy[0][0]), int(box.xyxy[0][1])),
                          (int(box.xyxy[0][2]), int(box.xyxy[0][3])), (255, 0, 0), rectangle_thickness)
            cv2.putText(img, f"{result.names[int(box.cls[0])]}",
                        (int(box.xyxy[0][0]), int(box.xyxy[0][1]) - 10),
                        cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_PLAIN, 1, (255, 0, 0), text_thickness)
    return img, results

# Predict and detect objects

result_img, _ = predict_and_detect(model, image, classes=[], conf=0.5)

# Show and save the result image

cv2.imshow("Detected Image", result_img)
cv2.imwrite("result.jpg", result_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

### Training a YOLO11 Model

To train a YOLO11 model for object detection:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a YOLO11n model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Train on a dataset (e.g., COCO)
results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
```
